# Learning Podman

Learning Podman interactively

## Notebooks

These are the interactive Jupyter notebooks.
**Note**: They work best with the built-in jupyter browser, as it can render colors.

Although they can be displayed in Bitbucket / Gitlab / GitHub, the color output reduces readability.

**Info**: Next section has links to exported documents.
